ΗΕ aim of this book is to furnish pupils who have given little
orno attention to the study oi English grammar o complete
course in Latia sor one year.

The book opens with a short and easy review of English gram-
mar. In the lessons, the changes iu the forms, uses, and relations
of words are explained and illustrated, so iar as is practicable,
from English, before introducing the Latin forms and construc-
tious. ln order to avoid or to lessen the hewilderment usually
produced in the mind oi the young beginner hythe use of a
complete Latin grammar, everything not essential to the structure
oi a simple sentence has, at first, been carelully excluded. Iu
short, no effort has been spared to smooth the way ior the
begiuner, and to prepare him lor the intelligent reading of Caesar
or ol any oi the less difficolt Latin authors.

Much care and study have been expended on the order and
arrangement oi the lessons, especially in the earlier part, aimiug

' mainly at two things: First, to introduce very early in the course

⁴ the simple verhlorms, which are easier than the nouos aud open
the way to a wide range ot expressiou3 and, secondly, to give not
bare words and their inflectione, but sentences from rte stari, with
both questions and auswers, in natural and easy succession. The
vocabularies at the head oi each lesson and the exercises for trans
lation, both Latin and English, will afford abundant material ior
drill on the forms. The teacher, however, will find it an excellent
oral exercise to combine these words into new sentences (both
Latin and English), requiring the pupil to give the translation.
r'rhe first associatione with any language‚ especially when learned
by the young, should be such as to make it as nearly as possiblea
living tongue3 the scientific study oi it should iollow, not go
before, some elementary knowledge oi what it is in actual speech.
I do not wish to be understood as advocating the neglect oi syntax
