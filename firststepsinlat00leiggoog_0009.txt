or 01 etymology, but simply as urging that the time often given to
parsing and memorizing and repeating formulas, which my experi-
enee has taught me help bnt little in the mastery 01 the language‚
can be much more profitably employed in the oral work just men·
tioned. The aim, 01 course, is to teach the pupil to read and write
Latin3 but may not this be accomplished more expeditiously and
pleasantly by making the languagc oliva—by teaclring pupils 10
specle, write, and read Latio as they are taught to speak, write, and
read a modern language‘l A German university student, 111110
classico be his specialty, learns not only to read and write Latin,
but even to speak it. 11 Latin is to maintain its present high
place in our courses 01 study, it must offer something better than
mere mental training or grammatical drill; it must introduce the
student tc the priceless treasures 01 art and literature which
the Romans gothered from the ancient world, and which, trans·

or universities should offer opportunities for students 10 acquire
a speaking knowledge 01 the Latin langnage? ‚

For those who prefer the English method 01 pronunciation, a
lew simple rules have been given. The socalled Roman method,
which is a very near approach to the ancient pronunciation, is now
adopted by many 01 our leading colleges and high sohools. Great

changes that occur in verbs in the formation 01 110 perfect and
participia] stems. A thorough knowledge 01 110 plenario 00100 of
tire letters ostie Roman 01010101 will help the student through most
01 these difficulties. 'This is quite aside from the question 01 prd-
nnnciation‚ which must, after all, be governed by the prevailing
usage. The quantity 01 syllabica, except final syllables that are
short, and the final 0 01 110 first person present indicative 01 verbs,
has been carefully marked, in order 10 secure accuracy 01 pronun·

to the Roman method, the pupil’s ear should be trained to it from
the start.
