-11111, called by many grammarians one 01 the principal parts 01 the
verb, belongs, 1111301, 10 only about 250 Latin verbs, then, again,
those verbs that are invariably intransitive have the perfect parti·
ciple in the neuter gender only. This part, then, called in the
dictionaries the supine 13-313, must, in 1303133333, be the neuter 01
the perfect participle; and 1 have ventured, in the enumeration 01
the principal parts 011113 verb, to give it this 33133, and also to
substitute, as Vanicek and other grammarians have done, in place
01 supine seem, the more correct term participio! stem. The retention
01 the neuter oi the perfect participle, in enumerating 1113 principa]
parts 01 the verb, instead 01 the masculine, is 01 importance 11013
11101331 just mentioned in regard to intransitive verbs, aud also
because it can be made tc conform easily to the present usage 01
our dictionaries. ·

The words in the short vocabularies at the beginning oi the
lessons‚ as well as the examples to illustrate 11131310301 syntax,
are mostly drawn from the first five chapters 01 Caesar’s Gallie
War. These vocabularies should be thoroughly committed 10

1113111011. The practice 01 selecting exanrples from authors 01

different periods and modes 01 expression tends, as it seems to me,
rather to perplex young pupils than to give them definite ideas 01

the structure and formation 01 3 Latin sentence. No effortis ⁴

made in these vocabularies to teach the derivation 01 1101113; but, in
the general vocabulary 31 the close 01 the book, the prefixes‚ 313133,
aud endings 01 the words have been 0313111111 indicated. ln the
chapter on the formation oi words, attention is mainly confined to
the formation 01 those words that the pupil can easily under·
stand, and that can bs made 01 service to him while studying these

Exeroises 101 sightreading have been introduced early in the
course. The lesson read at sight can be assigned as the regular
lesson 01 the next day, and made tc serve as the basis 101 addi·
tional drill in syntax and etymology. On the third day, the pupil
should be required to translate the 331110 1333011, as 3133333331-
cise, into clear and accurate English, absolutely disregardiug the
literal construction 01 the words and sentences. These exercises
will also afford ample means 101 practice in pronouncing Latin,
which is best acquired in reading connected sentences, as is the
case 13 3 modern language. But iu order to read Latin easily and
