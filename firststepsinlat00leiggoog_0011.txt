well, the oral practice, which I have mentioned, will be found a
valuable and almost indispensable aid.

My airn has been to introduce the pupil, hythe aidof easy
examples, to the correct use of words and to the chief principles of
syntax. When these examples have been studied‚ and the rules to
be derived from them are thoroughly understood, the exercises
that follow, both latin aud English, will be found sufficient to fix
these principles iu the memory. It is important, in fact indispen-
sable to thoroughness, ior the pupil to keep up the work of com·
position. If the exercises to he turned into Latin are too numerous,
then apert of them can be omitted until the review; but some
writing in Latin should he done every day.

The book may seem to some teachers to be too large for begin-
ners. But I have endeavored to keep in view the needs of young
pupils, and have thought it better to give too much explanation
rather than not enough. Then, again, the numerous examples3 the
explanatory notes3 the frequent illustration of Latin idioms ΒΥ
reference to English; the manner in which the paradigms are dis-
played3 and the adjustment of the type, by which the pupil can
leam not only the leading topios of the page, hut also the relative
importance of the various rules, remarks, and observatione, have
all necessarily added to the size of the book, but they will all, it
is hoped‚ be found helpful to the pnpil.

My acknowledgments are due to several of our best teachers‚
who have generonsly aided me ΒΥ their couusel in the plan and in
the numereris details of the book. The entire work, while going
through the press, has received, in addition, the valuable revision
and oversight of Gnoson W. Connonn, Professor of Latin in the
Cornnemrn nnn Ponrrsonwrc Irsrrrurs, Brooklyn3 of Casina
Hanarsow, sometime Professor of Ancieut Languages in the

many valuahle suggestions in the revision of the chapters on syntax3
