Ousunvamow. ln the study of English grammar, one ol the
first things the pupil has to do is to classiiy and name the various
words that he meets in his exercises. He does this in the same
manner that oue might pick out, sort, and group objects of any
kind: viz, by noting the points in which they resemble one au·
other. For example, we may, from certain resemblances inform
and structure, select all trees cf a certain kind, and call them
moptes,· from other resemblanceS, we should get another class
called acam and still another close, called heeches. 'Then we may
study each class, as the ouh, aud leam all that is perhaps necessary
to know ol the numerous individuals that composa the class. ln
the same manner, we may study and classily words. N oticing the
various ways the different words are used in sentences, we sort
them out, or group them, into eight classes which are called PARrs
or spnacn. Those words that nome objects are called N curm, from
the Latin word nomen, which means o nome. But we soon leam
that we cannot talk cr say anything about the noun without using
another kind ci word, called Vasa, from the Latin verbum, o
word. When a noun and a verb are combined so as to express a
thoughtdhe. so as to make sense, then a sentence (Lat. sententia)
is forme ;as,-

PRONOUNS.

Charlea ment to Rome with his mother, ond he come boch without
her. ln this sentence we make use cf three little words, called
Pnououws. They are his, he, and her. Without these words, we
should be compelled to repeat the nouus, and to say: Charlee ment
tc Rome with Chortes’s mother, ond Charles come boch without
Chorlee’s mother.
