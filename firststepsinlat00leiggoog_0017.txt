One. We have stated that the words oi our language may be
divided into eight classes, or parts, of speech. When we examine
these parts oi speech, we shall soon find it necessary to divide some
oi the classes into other classes. For example, the word city may
mean any city, ie. it is a name common to the whole class3 while
the word Bostou is a proper, or particular, name of an individual oi
this class. We may, therefore, subdivide nouus into commea and
proper. If we notice the use of nouus further, we shall see that
they undergo certain changes in form, meauiap, and use,· ior ex-
ample, tle trec proras, and the trees proto. Here we notice the word
trec changes its form hy assuming s; this change, or modification,
in the torm aud meaning oi the noun, tree, is called Numana. The
word tree, denoting one, is iu the stapular number; and the word
trees, denotin more than one, is in the plural number. Let us uosv
examine the following words :-

1. The Zion is strong. 5. We praise the author.

2. The lionae is strong. Ι 6. Ι, the author, hare written.
3. The author writes. 7. Auttor, hear thou.

4. The author’s book is read. 8. We call the author.

Ous. In Ex. 1 the pupil will notice that the word lion denotes a
male, in Ere? this word has been changed, or modified, in suun,
and now denotes a female. This modification oi the noun to
denote sea is called Garnae. There are three gendes—masculine,
feminiae, and neuter.

The changes that we have noted so iar, affect the meaaiap of the
noun3 there are two other changes of nouus seen in Exs. 3-8,
which affect the uses and relations oi the words. In aaa the
author is represented as doing an act, via, aritiup; in Ex. 4, as
possessiap a took, and in Ex. 5, as rcceiuiup au aetion. These uses
oi nouus are called Cusas. The use of the noun in Ex. 3, as suh
ject, is called the Noumnrrva Cnss3 its use in Er. 4, to denote
possession, is called Posssssrvn Cnss; its use in Exs. 5 and 8, as
object, is called Oasscrrvn Cass. The possessive is the only ease
oi the noun that is indicated by a change in form.

ln Exs. 6-8 the word author has three different uses. ln Erat
it denotes the speaker, in Ex. 7 the person spoteu to, and in Exs.
5and8 the person spolreu of. This change in the use oi nouns is
called Prason. There are three persons-the first person, as in
