Modtfloottons of Verbe.

MODE.

Oss. 1. When I say tte rnen strites, Ι assent striking as a fact.
Tne mon ntoy etrite ; in this sentence Ι do not essert the action as
aiact, but as esstote. Again, if the mun striTe, te citt be sorry;
Ι now essert the action, not as an actual fact, but as a condition oi
the 1nan’s being sorry. Ican also say, onon, strilce! but Ι do net
assert that the man does actually strike, but simply cotntnand him
to strihe. The action expressed by the verb etrite has been asserted
in four different ways, or orodes. The first is called the Iunrcarrva
Monr3 the second, the Pornrvr1ar›it¹ionn; the third, the Sun-
ouucrrvn Monn3 the fourth, the Inraaarrvs Mens. There is
another form oi the verb, which expresses action, but cannot assert
it oi a subject3 as tte wishes to strite. To etrite expresses the action
in a general way, without confining cr limiting it to a subject, it ie,
therefore, called the Iurrurrrva Mona, te. roitttont timit, untimited.

VOICE.

Oss. 2. T te mun struck the top. In this sentence the verb struck
shows that the subject, mon, is the actor,· it we change the sen·
tence, still expressing the same idea, to tte top eccs structo by tte mon,
then the verb, construet, shows that the subject is no longer the
octor, but is acted upon, or receives the action. This change in
the form ni the verb is called Voles. The first form is called
Acrrvn V010u3 and the second, the Passrvn Vcrca.
