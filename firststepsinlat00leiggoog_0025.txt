if we change the subject in the first sentence to tion, or to he,
we must then change the verb scrire to stre-ese, or to scribes. These
changes are made for the sake oi opreemenr between the subject
and the verb-the verb ending in est agrees with thou in the
second person, and the verb ending in -s agrees with he in the third
person. Both of these subjecte are singular number3 iithe suh
ject is plural, the verb rnnst be plura13 ns ihc men atrike. Hence,
verbs agree with their subjects in number and person.
