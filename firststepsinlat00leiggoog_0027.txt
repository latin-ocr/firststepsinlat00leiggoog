Adverbs.

Oas. A noun aod averb are both necessary in order to iorrn a
sentence. We have learned that modifying words are often added
io nouus to explain orto express the idea more clearly. Words are
often added to the verb ior· the same purpose. If we say, tle bey
reads, we express the fact in a general way3 but, if we wish to
spealr of the marruer of reading, then we sav, lde boy reads badly,

adding the word badim if, of the time, we add the word now: rae
bey reads a0w; nithe place, we add the word here: tle boy read
ltere. We may joiu words to these modifiers‚ arrd say, the bey reads
very badly, thatin, very modifies badly ,· we may jcin a word to an
adjective, aS, that book is very qood. These words that we join
with verbs, adjectivae, 01· ciluerba to modiiy their meaning, are called
Anvsnns (Lat. ad, to, aud verbum. a nord, or verb).
