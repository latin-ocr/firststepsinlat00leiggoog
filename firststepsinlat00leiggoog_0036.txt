Oricia of Latera—The Latin language was spoken at
Rome and in the adjoining district, the plain of Latium, from
which latter it derives its name. It is closely related to the
tongues spoken by the Samnites, Sabines, and other kindred
rauce, to which the general name of Satellius has been
given. These Sabellian tribes, on first entering Italy, settled
along the mountain ridges, from which they descended to the
plains like streame that fiood and fertilize the valleys. The
Latius, who settled near the Tiber, belonged to the oldest
ol these successive migrations3 then came the Sabines, the
Aequians, HernicanS, and Volseians, who at first pressed
hard on the Latine, and hemmed them into the narrow plain
between the Tiber and the Alban hilis, but in course of time
coalesced with thern and formed one nation.

How Baetem-The Latin, as well as the Greek, San·
skrit, Teutonic, Celtic, and Zend, are all sister languageS,
and together help to form the Indo-European family. The
original language from which these sprang was spoken by
the progenitore ol all these pcoples‚ who once lived together
somewhere in Central Asia, and by successive migratione
pcopled India and Europe, whence the name Inoo-Europaeo. ¹
The name Aryan (pronounced ἐῆν-μανι) is often applied to
this parent language, and to the grcups that have descended
fremit.

Wherc spureo—The conquesta of the Romans caused
the Latin language to spread, not only over Italy and Sicily,
but over the greater partos France and Spain.
