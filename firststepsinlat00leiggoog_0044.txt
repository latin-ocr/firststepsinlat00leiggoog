LESSON III.

SYLLABIOATION.

2⁵. A'Latin word is divided into as many syllables
as it has vowels or diphthongs.

Oss. The English words cille, accurate, separate, abate, would,
as Latin words, be syllabicated as follows: m1·le, acea-rfi'te,
sepa-rete, a-ba'te.

26. A single consonant between two vowels is joined ¹
to the second vowel.

ExAMPLEs.
1. father. artiscn. 3. re-gi'na. queen.
2. law-do, I probe. 4. d6‘-m1-nus,lord.

, 27. When the consonant is doubled, the first belongs
to the first syllable, and ,the second to the second
syllable.

ExAMPLES.
l. an'-nus, year. 3. pen'·na‚sectlter.

2. bel'-1um,wor. 4. mit'·to, I send.

28 Two or more consonants not doubled between two
vowels belong to the following vowel, but l, m, a, r, in
connection with another consonant, are joined to the

preceding vowel.
