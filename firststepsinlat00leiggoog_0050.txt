(b) a, c, 0, before a single consonant (or a mute with l or r) fol·
lowed by two vowels‚ the first ol which is e, i, or y, bave the long
sound3 as, impe'ri-um, do'ceo, dori-a„

4. In all unacoented syllables the vowel-sound is·-

o. Long, if followed by a single consonant (or a mute with l or r):
as ‹io-lotia but final syllables ending in a consonant are short,
in a vowel, long; as, con-sul (except es, and in plural cases os at
the end of the word).

h. Short before a, or any two consonants3 as, bel-lo‘rum,
rex-isset

Exonerron. Finalo is s'ounded as in the last syllable oi Amerino,
as mess'sa3 and the vowel-sounds in tibi and sibi arc as in the
Englis lily.

Nora. Compounds generally follow the same rules3 but ii the
first part ends in a consonant, the vowel-sound is short: as, obit,
red'it arb-e‘rat. prae-tenea, transi-tur (except post and its
compounds, and final syllables in os audocni plural cases: as,
post-quam, hos‘oe). ,

5. Diphthongs follow the same mles as the vowels which
represent them in English3 thus,—

o. ω and oe have the sound of e3 that is, long in cae‘lum, a-moe'-
nus, short in haesi-to, amnt-tas.

h. ln poetry ei may be regarded as adifihthong, asin deln‘de,
having the sound of i in mind3 eo, ou, oi, ave, w ren diphthongS,
the same sound as in send, author, coia, as Orpheus, Oileus. aarum
ai is a diphthong‚ having the long sound of i in hulc. cui, hui;
a, in connection with other vowels or diphthongs, sometimes has
the sound of w after 9 or s, as qui. lin‘gua, sua'deo. quae‘ro.

c. In such words as Gaius, Pompeius, Aquileia, i is sounded
like p3 as, (ἓξ-γης, Pompe-yma etc.

l ξ. Chonsonants have generally the same power as in Eng-
is ; t us,—

o. Before e, i, p, and the diphthongs oe, eu, oe, c has the sound
of s, and pol j3 ch has always the sound of lc, as in chemin ; c, s, t
olten hare the sound of sh before i followed by avenel, and before
eu when preceded hyan accented syllable, and a of lah, as socius.
censui, ratio, caduceus, anxius.

Nora. Il is to be understood that in these examples the rnle is

onl permissive, and that usage varies considerably among the best
autliorities· ln general, when the word, or the combination οῖ’

lettere, is distinclly foreign to ns, it may be better to retain the pura
consonant sound, as in men-tiebat, Min'cius. ca-du'ce-us,
Ly'si-aa samar-a, ax·1·o'ma‚ noo'ti-um„
