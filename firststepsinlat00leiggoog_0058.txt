FIRST CONJUGATION.

Nouus ANB Qnmsnous.

1. The endings were originally personal prononns: laudas means
not love, but thou locent. The pronoun, when used as the subject of the
verb, need not, therefore, be expressed. Note, further, that the endings
show the number and person of the subject, but not the gender.

Ons. This is true, in general, only when the verb is of the first or
second perron With the third person,a definite subject should be ex·
presseal, unless implied in what precedes or follows.

2. Note that the l'resent Indicative :present rtem † personal eud·

ings, and that dmi-l ο = dmm also, that it has lost the m (which
appears in eum, inquam). The o stands form and the preceding

vowel; es, dmo = emacem.
3. Read, I proice, etc. ¹

4. The stem is lauda, and by adding the personal ending we get
laude-o, ulrich is contracted into laudo.

b. Remember that the present tense iu English has three forms z —

1. laudo, Ι proice, I um praisinp, Ι do prur'se.
2. laudis, thou pruiscat, thou ort proinhq, tlon dost preire⁴

3. laudet, he proicer, he ia prais-inp, he doen pruine.

6. Observe that no separate Latin word is required for the pronouns
I, thou, he, we, they, ete.; thus, pugnamus, ue figit, contains the pro-
noun we, and is a complete sentence in one word, ie. contains a subject

and predicate; as,
pugna-mue

fiydt-we

pfignd, signifying sight, is the stem, and mue, signifying we, the
personal ending.
