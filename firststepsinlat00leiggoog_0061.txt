LESSON XI.

annin noers.
⁴ ΙΝΡίΕὒΤΙΟΝ.

59. The meaning oi Latin noune is altered by In·
flection3 that ie, by changing the form of the word,
generally the audinga, to denote some modification of
its meaning, or to show its relation to other words.
The Infiection of noune, of pronouns, and of adjectives‚
is called Deciensioa. The inflection of verbs is called
Oonjapotion.

Stem aad suffia.

60. The body of the word, to which the sufflx is attached,
is called the atem ; as,

militis: maltr- is the stem, and -ir the termination.

When the stem ends in a vowel and the suffix begins with
avowel, contractiori takes place, and the final vowel of the
stem sometimes disappears; as,

mensae: the stem is menso, and the suffix o-s, which unite
to form mensae, the s being dropped.

1. anh case-form, therefore, contains two distinct parts:
the stom, which gives the general meaning of the word3 and
the cose-suffla, which shows the relation of that meaning to
some other word3 aa, in

militis, of o soldier.- the general idea, soldier, is expressed by
the stem milit-3 the relation os, by the suffix de.

OBs. It may be found convenient to divide inflected words not
only into stem and terminatim, but into bose and termination, the
base1 being the part of the word that remains anchanged by indec-
ti0n; as, servus (which stands for servos), a slave, gen. servi, of
a slave. servo· is the stem, -ῑ is the terminatam, or· casesuffix;
theo is dropped before i to form servi, of o slave ,· but serv, to
which the casaendings are added, remains unohanged by inflection,
and may be called the bose.
