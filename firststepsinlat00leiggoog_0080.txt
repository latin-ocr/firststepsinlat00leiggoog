1. a and ὃ are used only before words beginning with a consonant;
ab and ex before either a vowel or a consonant.

2. A preposition with its noun is a phrase ,· when the phrase limits a
verb, as it does in this case, it is called an adverbial phrase; when it
limits anoun, it isan adjective phrase. No special model is necessary
for parsing nouus= with prepositions.

ad and ab. in (with the accusative) and ex denote motion to andsrom
the incide of a place; ad and ab (or a) denote motion to and from the
oatside of a place. Thus, venit in Italiam, when one coines luto Italy,-
εκ Itane, when one comes out ofItaly; but ad Italiam, to Italy, when
there is no notion ol entering into Italy conveyed; just so ab Italia¹

‹Irtrrgclry from Italy, when it is simply expressed that he came away froin
y.
