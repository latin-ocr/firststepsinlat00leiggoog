Ons. In the foregoing examples, note that in Ex. 1 the adjective

x. ea ecrve1s connece wi enoun means ο re
verb est Tlie first adjective is called au aurinand adjective, the
second is a predicate adjective, and is called the compleuerat. ln
Ex. 3 note that the descriptive noun filia stands iu the sanie art

appositive. ln End the descriptive noun is used to iorni the
predicate, and is called a predicate noun, cr complentem. N cte that
the predicate adjective agrees with its noun in ponder, nurrrber, and
ense, the predicate noun agrees with the subject in ease. Note
the position oi the predicate adjective3 it may, however, precede
the verb for the sake oi emphasis. ln Erus> the verb sum helps
to form the perfect tense of the verb, and is therefore called an
anniliory verb, hence,-

oerb. It is an auxiliary verb when it helps to form some of
the tenses of other verbs; it is copulative when it joins the
subject to some other word which is used to describe the
subject. The word thus used to describe the subject may be
a noun or an adjective, and is called the compleuerat. If the
descriptive word is a noun, it is called a predicamentum if
it is an adjective, then it is called a predicate adjective.

usually after intransitive verbs oi to be, to become, lo remeia, etc,

and with passive verbs of noriano, oallinp, eleusino, appoinlinp, etc,
it is called a Pnnnrcnru N ourunrrvu.
