Exempto.
miles fortiter pognat, lte soldier fiqtts brovely.

Oas. In the toregoing sentence, note that tte soldier fiptls ex·

presses a fact in a general way. We ma add a word, and say
the soldier fiptts brooely ,· we may add a worg to brooch, and say lle
soldiers fiqtl very bravely. Here ceres modifies brovely ; very bravely
modifies the predicate. Such words as very end trooely are called
oneass (ad, to, and verbum, word, or vert). This use of adverbs
is expressed in the following rule :-

USE 01⁴* ADVERBS.

152 Rome XVL—Adverbs modify verbs, adjec-
tives‚ and other adverbs.

153. Rnle of position:-

The adverb generally precedes the word it linrits3 but lete
usually stands between the adjective end the noun; as, omnes
ῐόῐδ hbmines, almost au rnen.

Voe'ces of Verbo.

P 154. Transitive verbs have two voices, the Active and the
asswe.

l. The cotiae oor'ce shows that the subJ'ect is the actor.
2. The possloe coice shows that the subject is acted upon.

EXAMPLES.
1, ωᾰςίετοῐ laudat, tte toacher praises.
2. discipulus laudetur, the pupil is praised.
3. disclpolus laudatus est, lte pupil hos been praised.

oss, In the foregoing examples the form of the verb shows
whether the subject is the actor, or the thing acted upon. These
different forms ot the verb are called voice. The passive form in
En lish is compounded, and may be resolved into some form of the
verb to te, ant} the conplorent, which is the perfect participle of a
transitive ver .
