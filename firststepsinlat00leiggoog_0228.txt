Ons. In the sentence I wiell to see ou, the verb, to see, names
the action in an indefinite way, without hmiting it to any particular
subJeet; and hence, a verb that expresses an action in this un-
limited manner is said to be in the Infinitive Mede (Lat. infinitus,
wutout limit). The infinitiva expresses simply the action or state
implied in the verb in an abstraet manner, without specifying
either person, number, or time, and thus merely indicates whether
an action isin progress or completed. The infinitivo may be used,
like a noun, as the subject or o ject of a verb, but it differs from a
noun in several important particulars: (1) It may be modified by
adverte, but not by adjectives, as I mist το suu you rmnnnrsrsnr3
ἱὲ) it governs anoun or pronoun in the obJ‘ective like a verb. In

atin, the infinitive has voice and tense like a verb, but, like a
noun, admits of two cases: the nominative when it is the sub'ect
of a verb, and the accusative when it is the object oi a verb. ibe l
infinitiva is also used in Latin tore resent the tenses of the indica
tive mode in Indirect Discourse. ( or this use, see ³47.) Hence
the uses of the infinitive may be stated as follows :-

250. Uses of the Infinitive.

1. The infinitive is used as an indeclinable abstract noun
in the nominative and accusative.

2. The infinitive is used in Indirect Discourse to represent
the tenses of the indicative. (See 347.)

One. The infinitiva has voice and teate, and takes adverbial
modifiers like any verb, it governs the case of its verb.

251. In Latin there are Four Infinitives in each voice,-
tbe Present, Perfect, Future, and Future Perfect. They are

formed from the stems as follows : -

ncnvn vomu.

Present infinitive = present stem ÷ re.

Perfect infinitiva = perfect stem ÷ sse.

Future infinitivo = future participle and esse.
Fut. perf. infin. = future participle audiuisse.
