Oss. In the foregoing examples, note that the nouns added for
description (as consilii, pedunn ingenit, animi, auotdrltitis) are
all in the genitive case, und that, in every instance, the genitlve is
accompauied by au adjective (as maximi 011111ᾱό0101, excellentis,
magni, magnae). This genitrve cannot be used without an accom-
panyiug adjective: as, 0 mun of 101001 is 1101110 111ςό016001 (not
1161110 ingenii); but, 0 man ofqrcat 101001 is 1161110 magni 111εό1111
Note, further, that in every instance the relation expressed is be·
tween two nouns3 thus, 0 ditch offisleen scel is rossa quindecim
pedona but when latus is added, we must say fossa quindecim
11011611Ιέ10, 0 ditch fifleen feet deep. (Note that animi and auct&
ritable, in Ex. 4, stand in the predicate 01101 the intransitive verb
esse understood.) Α genitive added in this way to a noun for
further description is called a Dnscnmmvn Gnnrmvs, or a Garn-
1110 01 (1001111,οτ os Cnnnncrsnrsrrc; if it stands in the
predicate after an intransitive verb, it is called a Pnnmcnsn
Gnnmvs 01 Qunmrv, 010. Note hat in Exs. 1, 2, 3, under 291,
thenounsvrrtut0‚inganro,andsta aare added to express quality,
or for further description, and that these nouns are iu the 01101100.
