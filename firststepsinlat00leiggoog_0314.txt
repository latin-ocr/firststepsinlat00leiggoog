317. Primary and Secondary Tenses.

One. We have learned that tense denotes the time ot the action3
and as time admits ot a threefold division, into present, past, and
staura, there must be at least three tenses to represent an action in
present, past, or future time. But in each ot these tenses an action
may be represented as incomplete or as completed, and from these
two divisione erise six tenses ot the Latin verb3 viz. :-

l. The Present‚ denoting incompleta action in the present.
2. The Future, denoting incomplete action in the future.
3. The Imperfect, denoting incomplete action in the past.
4. The Perfect denoting completed action in the present.
5. The Fut. Peri, denoting completed action in the future.
6. The Plnperfect, denoting completed action in the pest.

Each of these tenses also represents the action either ae in prog-
rese (still unfinished) or at the close ot its progress (ie. as
now finishedpl. An action may further be represented as being
simply broug t to pass, without reference to its being continuone
or momentary, complete or incomplete. This distinction gives rise
to the indefinite or caristie stage of action, which has no seperate
tense form. It is expressed by the present tense for the present, by
the sature for the future, and hythe αονὶει (perfect definite) ior the
past. The following table will show these temporal relations :-
