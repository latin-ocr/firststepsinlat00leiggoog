In Exs. 1 and 2, the seciup is dated as present or pust, according
es the cominy is present or past3 and, us moy sec and miqll sec are
present aud imperfect (or pastp potential, respectively, so we use
the corresponding tenses of t e Latin subjunctive. Iu Ex. 3,
oreddret is used for believed, which isan aorist3 creditet would
also be used for a true imperfect (uus belleuinp). After primary
tenses, the perfect subjunctive is used 10 represent all past tenses
of the indicative or potentiel, except that unreal conditione (³26. 3)

must always have their own form, regardless cf the Sequence of
Tenses (³19).

c. The Perfect (Definitc) is properly a primary tense3 but as
its action is commenced in past time, it is often regarded as a
secondary tense, and is followed in the dependent clause by a
secundary tense.

1. The Present isoften used in lively narration for the Acrist,
or Historical, Perfert. We say in English, Cicero discusses tle im-
mortulity of tlte seul, discusses being the historical present. It is
used whenever the writer wishes to picture viridly some past event
as present. It is then really a past tense, and isususlly followed by
a past tense in the subordinate clause3 though often it is followed
by a primary tense, with past meaning like itself.

c. The subjunctive has no future or future perfect tense; these
tenses are, in general, represented in dependent clauses, after a
primary tense, by the present or the perfect respectively (circum-
stances determining whether the present subjunctive is equivalent
to the present or future, etc.; cf. Exs. in 318); and after a secundary
tense, hythe imperfect or the pluperfect. But whenever the action
in the subordinate clause is to be represented as subsequent to the
future of the leading verb, the periphrastic form is used, composed
of the tenses of esse in combination with the future active parti-
ciple. (See 285. Obs.)
