Oes. 1. Instead of the periphrastic form, ilitiirum sit (or esset)
ut may be used3 and these words muri ιι used when the verb has
no participial stem, aud therefore no periphrastic form (and also
for the future perfect active, which is wanting in the periphrastic
conjugation); as, non dubito quin scriptumne = ιιόιι debito
quin litterum sit, ιιι scribas, I do not doubt ιιαι you will write.

Oris. 2. The future perfect represents both the perfect definite
and the eorist‚ transferred tc the future3 es, fecero, I ιιοιι tave
done ιἰ, or Ι shall do ιἰ. The future perfect is used with a much
greater exactness in Latin than in English3 es, ut sinentem
fecem. ita mites. as you ιιοιι have sewu, so will you resp. The
English idiom often uses the present, or the simple future, for the
fptprlre perfect: αι you sow, or οι you ιιαιι soro, instead of as you
ιο tave sewu.

Oresti. In applying the rules for the sequence of tenses, consider

(1) whether the leading verb is primary or secundary3 (2) remem-
ber that the tense of the Latin subjunctive is the seme ss the tense
of the indicative or potentiel in the English sentence (moy, corr,
'wilt and ιιοιι being present; eripit, could, would, and should, past).
