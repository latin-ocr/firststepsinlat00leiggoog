Oas. The ioregoing sentence contains a condition, is lte has
money, and is, therefore, called a Conmrronnn Snnrnncn. The
sentence is complex, because it consiste oi two clauses‚—a
principal, or leading clause, he gives lt, called the conclusion, and
a subordinate, or dependent clause, if hc las money, containing
the condition. The clause containing the condition iscalled the
Pnorns1s, and that containing the conclusion, the Anonos1s.

tion is,—in Latin ai, or a compound of st: as, nisi, unless (used
instead oi si non after negativos); etiamst, etsi, although ,· ain,

indefinite relative may introduce a conditional clause (seo 328).
