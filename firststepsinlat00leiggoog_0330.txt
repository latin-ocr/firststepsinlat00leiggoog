UNREAL russum AND Pnsr CONDITIONS.

1. If le lud money (le lons nol), le would yive il (now,
Imperf.or present time).

Plup. Subj. 2. If lle lud lad money (lle lad nol), le would ltaue
picen il (then, at some past time).

Oss. One of the most obvious classifications of conditional sen-
tences is that of (1) present, (2) pasl, and (3) salure conditions, the
distinction being based 011 the time to which the condition refers.
The pupil, however, should note that in Ex. 1 of the third set, the
imperfect denotes present time. We may, on the other hand,
classify conditional sentences as to their meaning, te. as to what

stated as a fact is this: granted the supposition, le. tltcl le los
money, and the conclusion must follow, le. le pices il. In Latin

of conditional sentences, the pnpil must take care not tc confound
such sentences with those in the third set. Observe the distinction
between ifle lud money, le yaue lt, and isle lud money (lle las nol),
le would pice il (now). The next two examples transfer the con-
dition to the future, and the question as to the lulfilment of the
condition is, cf course, at present undecided3 hence the uncertainty
of such conditions being fulfilled is greater than in present con-
ditions. Such conditions may be stated in two ways: the first
form, ifle slull love suency, is used to state a supposed future case
in a distinct and aluid manner; the second form, if le should lace

love lud money, the first being used for continuedllactiou and the
second (ie. the perfect) for completed action, ie. cornpleled at the
time denoted by the verb in the apodosis, although both forms are
usually rendered in English by the present. The third set of ex-
amples, if te lund money, le would qaue il, and if le lud lad money,
le would lave picen ll, transfer the conditions to past time, and
hence the time for the happening of the conditions has aheady
passed, te. they state the supposed case in such a manner that we
perceive the condition is unfulfilled, le. lle does nol hace money, aad
does not yloe il. In the first example the imperfect, α pasl leuse, is
used to state the unfulfilment cr unreality of the condition in present
lime. In both sentences the supposed case is represented as uareul,
or contrary rossel, and the conclusion states what would have been
the result if the condition had been fulfilled. ln Latin, the sub
junctive is used in both condition and conclusion,- in the first the
1mperlect, and in the second the pluperfect. The imperfect refers
