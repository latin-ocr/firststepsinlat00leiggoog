LESSON XCVIII.
INDIREOT msoouasn.

Ons. 1. Direct Discourse (ordrici recta) gives the exact words of
the speaker or writer; as, Ariovistus said, “I nava cnosson rnn
Ruina '' = Lat. Ariovlatus dixit, “Rhenum transan’ The words
I lave crossed tte noane are in direct discourse; the original speaker
is represented by the narrator as speaking in the first person (be-

cause the speaker refers to himself), and the words are given pre·
cisely as they were uttered. Indireet Diseourse (drdtio obliqua)
uses the same words, except that some are changed to conform to
the construction of the sentence in which they are quoted. These
changes affeci onl the pronouns, pronominal adverbs, modes, and
tenses (but not afways all oi these), as, Ariovistus said rnnr nn

nnn cnossnn ran Rnrnn :Lat Ariovistus dixit se Rhenum r
arnonae. 'The original words, I tere crossed tte Rhion, have been ,

changed to thar te tad crossed tte Rbiae, to indicate the change oi
relation in the speaker3 the first person in English is changed te
the third, and the perfect tense to pluperfect, and, in Latin, the iu·
dicative to the accusative with the infinitivo, which together form

an infinitiva substantive clause, the object of the leading verb dixit χ

exanimae.
