One. 1. The perfect infinitive represents in Indirect Discourse
the perfect, the norist, the piupwfect, and the imperfect indicative.
When the leading verb is ιιι the future, the infinitire expressesa
double relation,- (1) to the time ci asserting, and (2) to the time
oi the oetion asserted3 es, dicet se scn'bere, ite roiii sup (1) ttot ite
is now wriinq, (2) that lte is rursu writinq, ie. et the time oi saying.
The future infinitive can be formed only from verbs thet havea
perfect assive participle. The want oi it is supplied by the use
ci the lilture infinitive oi sum (iere cr futurum esse) witha
consecutive clause. This periphrase sometimes occurs when the
regular forms might be used.

stands ior the present indicative (or sometimes dn the imperfect,
especially niter memini„ and thet the perfect infinitivo stands
ior any post tense oi the indicative.
