PRONOUNS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

354 In passing irorn Direct Discourse to Indirect, pronouns
oi the first or second person are regularly changed, if the sense
requires, to pronouns oi the third person, as follows :-

1. Pansam τ, ago (noa) is changed to forms oi the reflexive
εδ (sometimes ipae), tu is changed to forms of ille or is.

2. Possasslva: meua (noster) and tuus (vester) are changed
to forms of suus (sometimes genitive ol lpse or oi le).

ἷξε } are changed to forms oi ille or is;

nunc is changed to tum and tunc.

3. Dnnonsrnfflvn:

4. Inransivn: ipse may be retained, and then refers to the
principal subject, like an emphatic reflexive.

OBs. Hence we have two reflexives in some clauses, referring
to (l) leading subject, (2) subjectos the infinitiva.
