a. A Relative Clausa even in Indireot Discourse, may
take the indicative, ir it contains a statement on the authority
of the narrator (= the present speaker or writer), or if it
is a mere circumlocution.

EXAMPLES.

1. caesar per exploratores certior iactus est, ex aa parte
vici quam Gallis concesserat, omnes noctr'i discessisse,
Coesur roas informed tirouplr lais scouts liat all os rhem irad

2. quis neget haecomnia quae videmus deorum pdtestate
administrari, who would deny ilat rtis alote visible world is
manuped by tlte power astte pods!

Ons. The statement on the authority oi the present speaker or
writer is equivalent to saying that the statement is a fuct‚· hence,
the indicative is used. The relative clause quam . . . concesse-
rat, although standing in Indirect Discourse‚ is in the indicative,
because it is an explanation given by the writer himself (Caesar).
The relative clause quae videmus, may be considered as explana·
tory (ie. it is a circumlocution), and although introduced into the
indirect Discourse‚ the verb (videmus) is in the indicative, because
the marmerei making the assertion is not important enough to rise
into considerati0n3 hence, the verb remains in the mode in which
it would naturally be, viz. the indicative. The statement is virtu·
ally made on the authority oi the present speaker, because he does
not think it worth while to shift the responsibilit ; ie. it often
depende merely upon the feeling oi the writer whether he will use
the indicative or subjunctive.
