10101, Coesar had refused to divorce his wife, as Pompey had done.
His name was then placed upon the list 01 the proscribed, which
means that he could be killed by any partisan of Sulla who happened
to see him, and his property would be confiscated, 0 large reward
being first pnid to the assassin. Caesar tled 01 once from the capital,
and concealed himself among the Albans hills, until, by the interces-
sion 01 the vestal virgins, and many prominent men among the
nobility, Sulla was induced to grant a pardon. “You wish it,'' said
Sulla, “and I grant it; but in this boy there are more than one Marius.''

, Caesar, however, would not accept pardon‚ and so long as Sulla lived,

he avoided the capital. While in Asia Minor, he distinguished him-
self 01 the siege oi Mytilene lor Mitylene), winning the civic crown ior
saving the life oi 0 citizen. When the news 01 Sulla’s death reached
him, he returned to Rome; but, seeing that there was no prospect at
present 01 the popular party regaining power, he decided to withdraw
again from the capital, and to devote himself at Rhodes to the study
01 oratory, in which he had already gained some renown. On his
way thither he was captured by pirates, with whom the Mediterranean
Sea at that time swarmed, because the governrnent at home had been
for many years so inefflcient and lax. The pirates demanded twenty
talenta —nearly twenty-five thousand dollars -ior his ransom. “ lt is
too little,” said Casan “you shall 11010 tiity3 but once free, I will

liberty than he manned some vessels, overpowered the pirates, and
conducted thern to 0 neighboring city as prisoners.

On his return to Rome, Caesar used every means to increase his
popularity. His 01101110 manners, and still more his unbounded liber-
ality,won the hearts 01 the people. At the ageos thirty-five (assuming
the earlier date) he was Quaestor in Further Spain (ac. 68). Two years
1010101065) be was Curule AEdile, an office which gave him a good
opportunity 1ο win the 10101 of the people, because be was to have
charge 01 the public gemes and exhibitions. As AEdile, Caesar not
only embellished the iorum and public buildings, and exhibited three
hundred and twenty pairs 01 gladiatore equipped in silver‚ bnt in all
the diversione 01 the theatra, in the processione and public tables, he
101 outshone the most ambitious 01 his predecessors. His prodi·
gality was irightiul, his debts enormous, amounting at this time to
more than one hundred million sesterces-nearly five million dol·
lars. When the chief pontifi died (0.0. 63), the most- illustrious men
oi the state sought the office. Caesar, however, did not give way to

them, although Catulus, one of his opponeuts, who had been Consul,
