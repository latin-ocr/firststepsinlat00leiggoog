and was nowa prominent member of the senate, fearing to be defeated
by one so much inferior in rank, station, aud age, offered Cacsar large
sums of money to pay his debts, if he would withdraw from the con-
test. On the morning of the election, Caesaris reported to have said
to his mother, who would gladly have had him withdraw from the
struggle, “I shall this day be either chief pontifi or an exile.''

The next year Caesar was Praetor, and as Propraetor he went, at
the end of his year of office, to govern Spain. Before hia departure,
his old friend Crassus, the richest man at Rome, had to pay a part of
his debts, and to stand security ior the rest to the amount of nearly a
million oi dollars. Caesar is reported to have said in his reclrless way
that he needed a hundred million sesterces to be worth just nothing at
all. In Spain he displayed that civil and military ability which after·
wards made him famous. It must have been a strange sight to see
this dissolute spendthriit‚ this profligate demagogue, with his counte
nance pale and white, withered before its time hythe excesses of the
capital, this delicate and epileptic man, walking at the head oi his
legions, and fighting as the foremost soldier with the wild tribes of
Lusitania.

On his return to Rome, Caesar found Pompey, who had just com·
pleted the Mithridatic war in the Rast, and was arranging for his
triumphal entry into the city, at varianae with the senate. Caesar at
once saw his opportunity, he formed a political coalition with Pompey
and Crassus, one part of the bargain being that Caesar should have
the consulship for the next year (ac. 59), and after that the govern-
ment of Gaul for five years. In accordance with this programme,
Caesar was entrusted, at the expiration of his consulship, with the
command of Cisalpine Gaul, Illyricum, and the province oi Narbo,
or simply provincia, with three legions, for a term of five years.
Caesar had now attained his object. As Proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul,
he could watch the progress of affairs in the capital, while the threat-
ening movements of the tribes in Gaul opened to him the prospect of
subjugating the country and training an army for the impending civil
avar, for Caesar no doubt then clearly saw that a struggle between him·
self and Pompey for the chief power ut Rome was inevitable.

For along time the Romans had felt the importance oi possessing
Gaul, but as yet no systematis effert had been made to extend their
dominion in that quarter farther than occupying the seaboard between
the Alps and Pyrenees (rac. 121). The climate of Gaul was health· ·
ful, the soil rich and fertile, and the intercourse with Rome easy by
laud and sea. Roman merchants aud farmers had already emigrated
