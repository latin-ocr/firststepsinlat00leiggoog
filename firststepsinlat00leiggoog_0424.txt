in great numbers to Gaul, and disseminated Roman culture and

ξ civilization to such an extent that many of the tribes could transaet
Ῠ business with Roman ambassadors in the Latin language. The centre ·

of this civilization and refinement was the old Greek city Massilia;
’ also the resort of those who had been banished from the capital. The

³ merchants stationed there carried on an extensive trade with the intr·-

rior of Gaul, anderen with Britain. They transported their wares up
¹ the Rhone and Saone, and thence by land to the Seine and Loire, or
across to the Garonne, and so to the Atlantia. This intercourse pro·
«luced a close connection between the tribes from the Rhone and the
Garonne to the Rhine and the Thames. Caesar saw how essential the
possession of this country was to the Roman state, and that to its con-
queror was offered the prospect of surpassing the fame of Camillus

¹ and Marius.

Of the population of Gaul, the AEdui had entered into an allianee
with Rome, while the Belgae in the north, and the Sequani in the
south, sought an alliance with the Germans. Tm AEdui, relying on

ἵ the assistance of Rome, imposed heavy tolls on the navigation of the
Saone. The Sequani complained bitterly of this, and thinking that

i the Roman government was too much occupied with its own conten-

¹ war for their recovery, or to solicit the aid of Rome. Divitiacus, the
s chief magistrate of his clan, alone refused to sign the treaty, and fied

to Rome to ask assistance. Ariovistus now invited other tribes across

, the Rhine, and demanded land to settle thern 0n; the whole frontier of
' Gaul, from the sources of the Rhine to the ocean, was threatened by
¹, the invasion ol the German tribes. These tribes so pressed upon the

ὓ Helvetians, who were hemmed in on the south and the west by the Alps,
Lake Genava, and the lura Mountains, that they determined to aban-
don their country to the Germana, and seek larger and more fertile
fields in the west. Caesar, on the expiration of his consulship, had
remained in the vicinity of the capital until he accomplished his· politi·
cal schemes. But when the news reached hinr that the Helvetii had
abandoned their homes, and were advaneing upon Genera with the
purpose of crossing the Rhone and forcing their way through the ’
Province, he hastily made his preparations, reached the Rhone in
eight days, and by skilful negotiations delayed the advance until a
