lineos eutrenchments had been constructed from Lake Genava to the
Jura Mountains. Deieated in the attempt to crosa the river in this
direction, the Helvetii were compelled to take their way along its
right bank, and thus make their journey westward bya more north-
erly route. Caesar hastily collected his iorces, followed up the left
bank oi the Saone, cut to pieces in a fierce battle a part oi the Helve
tian army, and pursued the remainder to Bibracte, where he defeated
them in a terrible battle, and compelled the survivors to return to their
native country and rebuild their homes.

1. Gallia: Gaul extended from the Pyrenees and the Gulf of Lyons
on the south to the British Channel and German Oceau on the north.
It was bounded on the west by the Atlantia Ocean, and on the east by
the Rhine and Italy. It was called Transalpina (ie. beyond tle Alps),
to distinguish it from Cisalpina (ie. on tlzr's side of tle Alpa), in north-
ern Italy. It included France, Belgium, part oi Switzerland and Hol-
land, and the part oi Germany west oi the Rhine. In the division
which Caesar here makes he does not include the southeast part, called
Gallia Narbonensis, or commonly Provincia, whence the modern name
Provence. The Roman dominion in the Provincia was secured hythe
establishment oi Narbo Marcius, a Roman colony on the Atax, in
a.c.121.

The most remote Roman towns towards the west and north were Lug-
dunum, Convenarum (or Convenae), Tolosa, Vienna, and Geueva. The
country was well provided with roads and bridges. The commerce on
the Rhonc, Garonne, Loire, and Seine was considerable and lucrative,
and extended even into Britain. The people were tall, oi fair complexion
and oi sanguine temperament, fond of fighting, but easily discouraged.
They were skilled in working oopper aud gold. Copper implemento of
excellent workmanship, and even now malleable, have been found in the
tombs in many places in Gaul. The Romans are said to have learned
irorn them the art oi tinning and silvering. The Gauls, or as they
called themselves the Celts‚ had attained so much akill in mining,
that the minere, especially in the iron-mineaou the Loire, acted an im-

portant part in sieges. There was no political union among the different
clans, no leading canton for all Gaul, no tie, however loose, uniting the
whole nation under one leadership. Sometimes one canton would ex·
tend its power over aweaker one, as the Suessiones in the north, tho
maritime cantons in the west, the two leugues in the south, one headed
by the AEdui, the other by the Sequani; but the Celts as aranon lacked
politieal pnity‚ and the cantous, ior the most part, existed independently
