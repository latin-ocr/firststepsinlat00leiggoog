The following brilliant description oi the battle near Bibracte is from
Mommsen’s History of Rome (vol. iv. p. 253, Eng. cdl: “The two
armies posted themselves on two parallel chains of hills; the Celts
began the engagement, broke the Roman cavalry which advanced into
the plain, and ran onward against the Roman legions posted on the
slope oi the hill, but were there obliged to give way before Caesar’s
veterane. When the Romans, thereupon following up their advantage,
descended in their turn to the plain, the Celts again advanced against
them, and a reserved Celtic corps took them attha same time in the
llank. The reserve oi the Roman attacking column was pushed forward
against the latter ; it forced it away from the main body upon the bag-
gage and the barricade oi wagons, where it was destroyed. The bulk
oi the Helvetic host was at length brought to give way, and compelled
to beat aretreat in an easterly direction, -the opposite of that towards
which their expedition led them. This day had frustrated the scheme of
the Helvetii to establish ior themselves new settlements on the Atlantia
Ocean, and handed them over to the pleasure of the victor; but it had
been ahot day also for the conquerors.''
