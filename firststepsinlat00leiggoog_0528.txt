The standing of this Grammar is now so well established that no
extended comments or description need be given.

1. lt has been used and recommended by teachers of Latin every-
where—particularly in the large and in the distinctively classica]
schools, where an independent judgment might be expected.

2. lts firmest friends are those who have used it longest.

3. The clearneSS, simplicity‚ conciseness, convenience of size and
arrangement, and economy of matter, essential in a class-room man-
ual, have been secured without sacrifice of rigid scholarship, as is
shown by the emphatic endorsements of eminent authorities.

4. To place before the public in authentic form the exact status
of the question, the publishers print a series of testimonials from
prominent professors and teachers, representing 132 colleges and
452 schools. The latter include about 72‚ooo students. These
letters, which have a judicial value as the independent judgments ol
competent and disinterested men, pronounce the grammar

“Especially suited to beginners.‘' “ Brief and concise.”

“ Broad‚ comprehensive, and complete.'' ‘⁴ Simple aud clear.’'
‘⁶ Thorough‚ accurate, and scholarly.'’

“ Systematic, scientific, and philosophical.''

‘·' Praetical, and satisfactory to teachers and to students.'’

⁴¹ The best extant.” [Send sor tlte [Μαῖαν]

At the present time, ¹inasmuch as the grammar has no longer
against it the natural conservatism of the schools, and the no less
natural prejudice of an entire corps ol teachers trained in the methods
of other books, its continued and increased success is not surprising.
