jects of art. Fully annotated, for School and College Use, by J. B.
GREENOUGH of Harvard University.

The text follows Ribbeck in the main, variations being noted in the
margin; and the references are to Allen &Greenough's, Gildersleeve’s‚
and Harkness’s Latin Grammars. Supplied in the following editions:

The notes are designed to give not only what may serve the
learner in the bare understanding of the text, but, along with it,
some hint of that wealth of traditional interpretation which is more
important, perhaps, in the study of Virgil than in that of any other
ancient poet.

· The many wood=cuts, taken from ancient objects of art, will serve

to illustrate the poet's conception better than annotations alone
could do.

ln preparing the Vocabulary to accompany his virgil, or for use
with other editionS, the author has had two things in view: first, to
supply as much information as was possible in regard to the history
and uses of the Latin words, so that the book should not be a mere
key to translate by, but should also furnish means for the study of
the language itself; and, secondly, at the same time to give or sug·
’ gest a suitable English expression for every passage.

The actual quantity of vowels, where known, has been indicated,
irrespective of syllahic quantity, in order to aid the proper pronun·
ciation of Latin words.

'tracy Fecit, Professor of Latin, vord college: Iam much pleased with
Vale College .· The Vocabulary, both in it. The notes seem to be full of valna·
plan and execution, is superior to any ble suggestion, and the Vocabulary is
school-book vocabulary known to me. a real improvement upon anything of
(March 1, 1883.) the kind which Ι have seen before.
